# MS in AI Curriculum

---

The Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence is a 30-credit-hour program designed to provide both a strong theoretical foundation and specialized, hands-on skills. The curriculum is structured to be completed in approximately two years.

### Degree Requirements

To earn the M.S. in Artificial Intelligence, students must complete 10 graduate-level courses (30 credit hours) with a grade of 'C' or better in each course. The structure is as follows:

*   **4 Required Core Courses (12 credit hours):** These courses provide the fundamental knowledge base for all students in the program.
*   **4 AI-Related Elective Courses (12 credit hours):** These courses allow students to tailor their degree to their specific interests within the broad field of AI.
*   **2 Open Elective Courses (6 credit hours):** Students can choose any two graduate-level (5000+) computer science courses to broaden their knowledge or deepen their specialization.
