# Pathways Program for Non-CS Majors

---

The Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence is built on the principle that the future of AI will be driven by innovators from all disciplines. The Pathways Program is our dedicated entry route for highly motivated applicants who hold a bachelor's degree in a field other than computer science or a closely related area.

This program provides the essential foundational knowledge in programming, computer systems, and algorithm design required for success in our rigorous graduate curriculum.

### Program Structure

Students admitted through the Pathways Program must complete a set of undergraduate-level foundational courses before beginning their graduate coursework. This ensures that every student who enters the MS in AI program has the shared technical proficiency needed to thrive.

The graduate advisor will work with each student to determine the exact set of required courses based on their unique academic and professional background. In some cases, students with prior programming or quantitative experience may be able to waive certain courses.

### Foundational Courses

The core of the Pathways Program consists of the following five courses. Students must complete each required course with a grade of "C" or better.

| Course Number | Title | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CS 5301** | Programming Practicum | Provides an intensive, graduate-level review of programming principles and data structures to accelerate readiness. |
| **MATH 3305** | Probability and Statistics | Establishes a fundamental understanding of basic probability and statistics concepts. |
| **CS 3358** | Data Structures and Algorithms | **(Most Critical)** The foundational course for graduate-level computer science, covering the design and analysis of algorithms. |
| **CS 3360** | Computing Systems Fundamentals | Covers key concepts in operating systems, concurrency, and networking that are essential for building robust AI applications. |
| **CS 4379G** | Data Analysis and Visualization | Teaches practical, in-demand skills in Python and its data science ecosystem (NumPy, Pandas), directly preparing students for AI coursework. |

### How to Apply

You do not need to apply to the Pathways Program separately. Simply apply to the **M.S. in Artificial Intelligence** program through The Graduate College. Your application will be reviewed holistically. If you are a strong candidate who would benefit from foundational coursework, you will be admitted through the Pathways Program.
